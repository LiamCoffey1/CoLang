# CoLang

TODO:
- Code input options --> load file and multiple line input from console (currently single)
- Token generator needs pattern matching (regex)
- Types (duck for the moment)
- Expressions only support E => (id | value) + (id | value).. needs to be able to parse expressions on either side aswell... so E => E | E BinOp E | Id | Value
- Condition statements should use expressions that evaluate to booleans (only supports (id | value) == (id | value)) 
- Parsing for else statements

FUTURE:
- Variable Scope based on block
- functions
- Lists
