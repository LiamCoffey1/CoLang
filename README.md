TODO:
- Token generator needs pattern matching
- Expressions only support E => (x | int) + (x | int).. needs to be able to parse expressions on either side aswell... so E => E | E BinOp E | Id | Value
- Condition statements should use expressions that evaluate to booleans (only supports (x | int) == (x | int)) 
- Parsing for else statements

FUTURE:
Variable Scope based on block
functions
